| November 25 | 7:30-8:00pm |  I started by cloning the repository and looking at the compress method. I realized that what I wanted to do was have a for loop to go through the entire file, and count the number of 0s/1s are repeated. Once there is a switch in which number it is, I would stop the while loop and write that number down. Then, I would repeat until the file is finished. |
