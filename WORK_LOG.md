| November 25 | 7:30-8:00pm  |                                                             I started by cloning the repository and looking at the compress method. I realized that what I wanted to do was have a for loop to go through the entire file, and count the number of 0s/1s are repeated. Once there is a switch in which number it is, I would stop the while loop and write that number down. Then, I would repeat until the file is finished. |

However, my code still wouldn't work. I would just get a long string of 0s and ocasionally a 1 at the end of a line. I tried to fix it in class but I couldn't figure out what was going on. |
| December 1  | 8:00-8:45pm  | I spent a lot of time troubleshooting my problem. Eventually, I realized that the number of bits that I was printing was exactly 32 times the amount of the original file. I looked at my read and write functions, but they all seemed to be writing/reading the same amount of bits. Anyways, I spent all of my time trying to solve this. I got to a point where I had more 1s, but I was still printing way to many bits. |

I also looked at my compression and saw that, as expected, the larger the file, the better the compression ratio. |
